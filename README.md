## üìù How to Add Your Projects

Since your projects are in private company repos, here's how to present them:

### Project Template

```html
<div class="project-card">
    <div class="project-header">
        <h3>Your Project Title</h3>
        <span class="project-role">Your Role</span>
    </div>
    <div class="project-tech">
        <span class="tech-tag">Go</span>
        <span class="tech-tag">RabbitMQ</span>
        <!-- Add more tech tags -->
    </div>
    <p class="project-description">
        Brief description of what the project does and your contribution.
        Focus on the problem solved and technologies used.
    </p>
    <div class="project-highlights">
        <h4>Key Achievements:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantifiable result (e.g., "Reduced latency by 80%")</li>
            <li>Performance metrics (e.g., "Handled 10K requests/sec")</li>
            <li>Technical implementation (e.g., "Implemented retry pattern")</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="project-challenges">
        <h4>Technical Challenges Solved:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Specific technical problem you solved</li>
            <li>How you approached complex issues</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
```

### What to Include (No Code Needed!)

For each project, describe:

1. **Title & Role**: What you built and your position
2. **Technologies**: All tech stack components
3. **Description**: What problem it solves (2-3 sentences)
4. **Key Achievements**: Use numbers! (latency, throughput, scale)
5. **Technical Challenges**: Show problem-solving skills

### Example (Your RabbitMQ/Kafka Work)

```
Title: "Real-time Event Processing System"
Role: "Backend Developer"
Tech: Go, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Docker

Description:
"Built a distributed message processing system handling vehicle tracking 
events. Implemented reliable message routing with RabbitMQ for high-throughput 
real-time processing."

Achievements:
- Processed 10,000+ messages per minute
- Achieved 99.9% delivery reliability
- Reduced alert latency from 5s to 200ms
- Implemented idempotent processing pattern

Challenges:
- Preventing duplicate message processing across consumers
- Handling broker restarts gracefully
- Designing optimal routing key patterns
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I show projects from private repos?**
A: Yes! You don't need to share code. Just describe what you built, technologies used, and impact.

**Q: I don't have 3 projects yet**
A: That's fine! Start with 1-2 and add more later. Quality > quantity.

**Q: Should I include personal projects?**
A: Absolutely! Especially if they demonstrate relevant skills.

**Q: Can I add a blog section?**
A: Yes! Copy the projects section structure and modify for blog posts.

**Styling looks off?**
- Make sure `style.css` is in the same folder as `index.html`

   - Share on Twitter/X
   - Add to GitHub bio

2. **Get feedback**:
   - Ask colleagues to review
   - Post in developer communities
   - Iterate based on feedback

3. **Keep it updated**:

   - Update skills as you learn
   - Refresh content regularly

## üÜò Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check that all files are in the same directory
2. Make sure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Test locally before deploying
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

Good luck with your portfolio! üöÄ
